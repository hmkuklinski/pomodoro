# Usage

To use this, first click on the timer that you'd like to use: Pomodoro, Short Break, or Long Break.

When you want to start the timer, click on the Start button.

If you need to pause the timer you can click on the Pause button. Whenever you are ready to resume, you can click the Resume button.

If you would like to restart the timer, you can click the restart button. 
(The timer will revert to the Pomodoro option, but if you'd like to start another timer, you can click the timer type and then click start to refresh it)

There is the option to add tasks that you need to accomplish into the taskboard. Simply type in a short description of the task and then click the add button.
When you are done with the task, you can click the Done button to remove it from the task board.

# ToDo

I would like to have a user login option to store tasks and to create a section of past completed tasks.
